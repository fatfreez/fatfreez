The depending factor is whether or not there is enough tissue for the applicator to hold on to.</p><p>You need to have approx 2 inches of tissue that you can physically grab. During your consultation, the Doctor you meet with will be able to tell you if you are a good candidate or not.</p><p>We have been seeing great, consistant results w/ Zeltiq use on the inner and outer thighs. (Grant Stevens, MD, Los Angeles Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><em>The inner and outer thighs can be treated</em></p><p>There is a special applicator for the outer thighs, the inner thighs can be treated with a traditional applicator with some degree of overlap.</p><p>Results are great but you will need more than 1 treatment. Many people may need &gt; 2 treatments to see permanent results.

</div><p>CoolSculpting has an applicator specifically designed to treat the thighs, both outer and inner. Generally you can expect the same kind of results from the thighs as from other areas of the body – around a 25-30% reduction after one session.</p><p>Be sure to visit a board-certified, experienced dermatologist who will know where to place the applicator for the best results and who can make sure that you are a good candidate for the procedure. (Margaret Weiss, MD, Baltimore Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p>I find Coolsculpting to be an ideal treatment to sculpt inner or outer thighs. There are no irregularities, and in case there is any cellulite in the area, the condition is improved as well.</p><p>We had some limitations in the past because we had available only one size applicator with one profile , but now with the petite applicator we can treat any size or shape.</p><p>I would definitely recommend that you consult a physician who has all the applicators and has enough experience with inner thigh treatments.

</div><p>Both inner and outer thighs are very common areas for CoolSculpting. The key is whether or not there is enough tissue for the applicator, since you need to have about 2 inches of tissue that you can physically grab. The treatment takes about 45 mins and about $600. (Shamim Shakibai, MD, Los Angeles Physician)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting for thigh area</i></p><p>CoolSculpting is FDA approved to treat inner and outer thigh areas for fat reduction/contouring. To achieve the desired results, the CoolSculpting applicator needs to be able grab enough skin/fat tissue.</p><p>A consultation would be required to determine whether or not you are a good candidate for the treatment.
