<div class="amp-wp-article"><div class="amp-wp-article-content"><p><em>Permanent Results With Different Treatment Plans</em></p><p>The amount of treatments with Coolsculpting all depends on the patient’s expectations.</p><p>Some patients will do 1one treatment of the same area and some will do three treatments. With every treatment of Coolsculpting you do get a fat reduction of 20%-25%.</p><p>As long as you maintain a healthy lifestyle the results will be permanent. With Coolsculpting you are permanently reducing the fat cells in the desired area. This is why some patients may want to do more than one treatment. (Gideon Kwok, DO, Rancho Cucamonga Physician)</p><p><em>CoolSculpting Treatment for Stomach</em></p><p>The stomach can take anywhere between 2 and 4 treatments and can be done in an hour or 35 minutes per treatment depending on the hand piece the provider is using and how many CoolSculpting machines the office has.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_232" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>It is always best to have a consultation prior to your CoolSculpting procedure so the provider can lay out the treatment plan and go over all the logistics of the procedure. (DeEtta M. Gray, MD, Bellevue Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><h4>Coolsculpting Procedure</h4><p>The effects of the treatment are permanent. Fat cells do not reproduce or expand in size.</p><p>Once Coolsculpting eliminates fat cells from your body, they will not reappear if healthy exercise and lifestyle are maintained.</p><p>Each treatment reduces the fat in that area by 20-25%. The number of treatments depends on how much fat you are wanting to reduce, and in which areas. (Steven Gabel, MD, FACS, Portland Hair Restoration Surgeon)</p><h4>CoolSculpting treatment time and results</h4><p>A single CoolSculpting treatment takes as little as 35 minutes and with DualSculpting, you are able to have multiple areas treated at the same time which reduces overall treatment time. The number of treatments needed depends upon the areas to be treated and your desired result.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_233" class="wp-caption alignleft amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>At my practices, my CoolSculpting practitioners always conduct a full body assessment, discuss a patient’s areas of concerns and then create a personalised treatment plan for them. (Tracy Mountford, MBBS, London Physician)</p><p><em>Coolsculpting permamently removes fat</em></p><p>The procedure lasts between 2 and 6 hours. Often multiple treatments are necessary for the ideal result but only one treatment is required.</p><p>The fat reduction in the area treated varies from 14-42%. Our Michigan coolsculpting patients have a permament reduction in fat.</p><p>Only liposuction and zeltiq permanently remove fat cells convincingly. You will experience some soreness three days after the procedure.</p><p>You can still work, exercise, etc. It is our experience that at least half, or more, of the patients will take ibuprofen because of the soreness.

</div><h5>CoolSculpting Treatments</h5><p>Coolsculpting pricing is an individualized plan per patient Treatment Plan. During your consultation, your provider will customize a treatment plan specific to your needs after assessing your body. Applicators range from small to large and pricing is based on which applicator is being used along with the number of applicators being used. (Jon Paul Trevisani, MD, FACS, Maitland Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><strong>Treatments</strong></p><p>Usually on the abdomen (stomach), patents require 2-3 sessions over 2-3 months. During this time, the body is eliminating the frozen fat created by Coolsculpting. (Patrick M. Moore, MD, Murrieta General Surgeon)</p><h5>Coolsculpting treatments</h5><p>The Coolsculpting procedure permanently removes a percentage of the fat cells in the treated area. Typically patients see results anywhere from 1-4 months. As far as the number of treatments, it is necessary to have a consult with a certified practice professional in determining what your custom transformation package would be.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_235" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-614c45bb03f5a1ab883cf69378a6c227">

</div><p>Most patients are very satisfied after just one session, however some larger areas would need two treatments minimally. (Jennifer Cova, DO, Dayton Physician)</p><h3>How many treatments of CoolSculpting® will I need, and how long will they last?</h3><p>Typically, you’ll see a noticeable loss of fat in the treated area after one treatment, but many patients seek additional treatments to achieve even greater fat reduction. You may start to see changes as quickly as three weeks after your initial treatment, and will experience the most dramatic results after one to three months.</p><p>During that time, your body is still flushing fat cells and will continue doing so for up to four to six months after treatment. During CoolSculpting®, the treated fat cells are crystallized and then eliminated by the body.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_236" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-313fe935688988ae2e68b9ece196b42d">

</div><p>As long as you maintain a healthy lifestyle, long-term results should remain stable. (Ellen Turner, MD, Dallas Physician)</p><p><strong>Find out how long CoolSculpting lasts and how many treatments you may need</strong></p><p>CoolSculpting is a modern, non-surgical procedure used to reduce fat and contour specific areas of the body.</p><p>It is a technique proven to be extremely effective at reducing fat in areas resistant to diet, exercise and healthy lifestyle changes – particularly those known as “problem areas” (i.e., the upper thighs, abdomen and upper arms) CoolSculpting is also known as a permanent fat cell-reduction treatment. The treatment works by freezing fat cells without impacting or damaging the surrounding skin – a process called Cryolipolysis.</p><p>The frozen fat cells are quickly absorbed and excreted through the body’s own metabolic process. Results may take a few months to reach fruition but, once actualized, these results will last for years if patients mind what they’re eating and live an active lifestyle.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_237" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>The number of sessions needed will be determined by the area being treated as well as the individual’s target goal but, on average, most patients at my Vancouver cosmetic surgery practice will have at least two treatments.</p><p>Each session is typically an hour per area treated, and treatment time is generally comfortable and relaxing. (Thomas Buonassisi, MD, Vancouver Facial Plastic Surgeon)</p><p><i>How long is the CoolSculpting procedure ?</i></p><p>CooSculpting was launched as a single treatment protocol initially. However, through experience, physicians have realized that in some patients, a second treatment may be necessary to achieve the desired result.</p><p>When a potential patient visits us in consultation we either propose a 1 or 2 treatment protocol depending on the amount of pinchable fat they have in the area they wish to treat.</p><div itemprop="image" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject" id="attachment_238" class="wp-caption alignright amp-wp-inline-d4b208d423e1f6cd15eec751e42610ae">

</div><p>As far as treating the stomach or tummy area, the procedure typically lasts anywhere from 2-6 hours depending on the whether or not both lower and upper abdomen are being treated and also how many applicators are ideal for your treatment.</p><p>There is a specific treatment plan designed specifically for each person. Further, we offer CoolSculpitng Plus (adding Zwave technology gives faster and better results). (Manish Khanna, MD, FRCP(C), Montreal Dermatologic Surgeon)</p><p><i>CoolSculpting Procedure Time</i></p><p>Each CoolSculpting treatment takes an hour. Depending on which office you visit can determine the length of time for your total procedure. Our office offers DualSculpting, which helps reduce the total length of time of the procedure.</p><p>We can treat two areas at once with DualSculpting. Everyone has their own personalized treatment plan.

</div><p>At the consultation you will learn if you are a candidate for the treatment and how many treatments are recommended to see optimal results. (Jeffrey M. Hartog, DMD, MD, Orlando Plastic Surgeon)</p><h3>CoolSculpting Takes About an Hour</h3><p>A CoolSculpting procedure typically takes about 1 hour per area treated. If you are interested in reducing abdominal fat, the abdomen may be considered 2 areas, depending on your goals and body shape. Some CoolSculpting providers have 2 machines at their practices and can treat 2 areas at the same time (a process sometimes referred to as DualSculpting).</p><p>The number of treatments needed will depend on your aesthetic goals. Each treatment reduces fat in the area by 20 to 25%. Many of my patients are happy with the results of 1 treatment, and it is also common to schedule multiple sessions.</p><p>If you need more than 1 treatment for the same area, schedule the second treatment at least a month after the first one. (Daryl K. Hoffman, MD, San Jose Plastic Surgeon)</p><p>CoolSculpting is a great way to get rid of extra fat in trouble areas. The treatments are done by areas. For instance, an abdominal treatment might take 4 hours to complete, but you may need two treatments for full transformation due to the thickness of the fat.</p><p>Outer thighs might only take about 75 minutes to treat both in a practice that has DualSculpting (two machines). During your consultation, we would assess your problem areas, discuss your goals, then design a treatment plan to get full correction of your problem areas.</p><p>You’ll know before you leave the office how long the treatment will take and how many sessions you might need. There is no cookie-cutter answer without a consultation. (Carmen Kavali, MD, Atlanta Plastic Surgeon)</p></div>
