<div class="fullTableCell"> Can the O-shot increase the chances of pregnancy? 44 year old getting shot due to dryness/low libido.</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">O-shot will not help with pregnancy<br><i>Aug 14, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">O-shot uses Plasma Rich Proteins to help rebuild the tendons, ligaments, muscles, joints, skin, collagen, etc. The O-shot is place in the area right underneath the urethra and clitoris. It never enters the uterus where the magic of having a baby happens. Some providers place PRP in the vaginal vault to help rebuild the tissue there also, but it still does not enter the uterus. There is an approximately 25% chance each month to get pregnant with regular sex. This is why Infertility physicians...</div>

<div class="fullTableCell"> O shot and centrifuge ?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Centrifuge does matter<br><i>Aug 14, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Hi, thanks for asking this question. The Centrifuge used does matter for PRP. There are multiple brands out there that can be used for PRP. The faster it is, the better the separation. I use the Eclipse Easy Spin which Dr. Runels has authorized. For someone to be authorized by Dr. Runels, they have to buy the recommended equipment, otherwise they are at risk of losing their certification. So most likely your new provider will have an appropriate centrifuge.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Would the O-Shot help me with arousal?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">O-shot for arousal issues<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">O-shot uses your own blood to help increase the sensitivity of your clitoris. Arousal on the other hand is mainly due mental stimulation. With that said, an orgasm is a very complex set pattern. If you are not feeling an arousal due to poor stimulation, then the O-shot should help with you. If your inability to get aroused is due to pain in the area, stress, etc, then you would probably want to talk to a therapist first. Hope this helps.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Can you have O shot or G shot while on blood thinners like Plavix or baby aspirin. Or Femilift, Therm</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Blood thinners and the O-shot<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">It is recommended to not use Aspirin or any other blood thinners while doing the O-shot. It can increase the amount of bleeding. For someone that is on blood thinners, I would suggest the Viveve treatment that uses radiofrequency and cooling to help the body remake and strengthen the tissue in the area treated in a non-invasive fashion.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> How much PRP (in terms of ml) is standard for the o-shot?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Standard does is 5ml for the O-Shot<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">The standard dose is 5ml, 4ml for the vaginal and 1ml for the clitoris. Most providers will use the 11ml PRP draw kit and that will get them 5ml of PRP. Using a larger volume will not make the procedure last longer as there is a rate limiting step to the rejuvenation of the tissue and that rate limiting step is not the amount of PRP. If someone is telling you that, you might want to be weary as they probably weren't trained by the O-shot founder.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Has anyone heard of the Lady Spot Shot?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">O-Shot by any other name...<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Providers that provide the O-Shot were trained by the developer or his representatives and continue to pay for the licensing fee every month. With that said, there are many providers who got the training through the same company and then decided they did not want to continue to pay for the licensing fee. These providers will then have to make up their own name for the procedure. Other providers may have had their licensing fee rejected because the company found that they were cutting corners...</div>

<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Does getting an O-shot hurt?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">O-shot can be painless<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">As others have written, it all depends on your pain threshold, type of numbing cream and injected anesthetic. I personally use a numbing cream about 30 minutes before the procedure. We then draw your blood and go over the pre and post instructions. We spin down your blood during this time to collect the PRP. After all this, I will still numb the area with lidocaine so that my patients feel very little pain if at all.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Can someone get an O-shot without numbing the area first?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">O-shot without numbing<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">The short answer is yes, you can have the O-shot performed without topical or injected anesthetic. The long answer is why would you want to. If you are allergic to certain medications, you should discuss this with your provider to find a suitable alternative.</div>
</div>
<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Does the O-Shot really work? </div>
<div class="fullTableCell">O-shot does work in the right patient!!<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">O-shot does work. It can help you increase your sensitivity and orgasm. It can also help with lubrication and Stress incontinence if you are having that issue. You may look into the Viveve treatment which can help with vaginal laxity. Before making any decision, discuss what symptoms are bothering you with a specialist so that they can make a plan that bests suits your needs.</div>

<div class="fullTableRow">
<div class="fullTableCell"> Is PRP a viable option for incontinence for someone with MS?</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">PRP treatment for MS<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Without knowing how severe your MS is, it is very tough to say if you will get any benefit from the O-Shot. The O-shot uses PRP to help "rejuvenate" the tissue around the urethra so that there is increase pressure gradient. Also, is your incontinence due to MS or is due to aging/trauma etc for the tissue around the urethra. You should have a thorough exam done with someone that understand urodynamics. Once you know the culprit, you can better assess which modality for treatment will work...</div>

<div class="fullTableCell">Feminizing Hormone Pills<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">After reading your questions, I have some questions also. Are the physical traits you are describing similar in other family members? If so, this may just be your genetic make up. If this is not the normal for your family, the first thing I would want to make sure is if you share the same genetics with your family (adoption). If adoption is not the answer, then you need to see a specialist who can do a thorough physical exam and do the appropriate labs to see if there is a medical problem...</div>

</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">It seems that you have proceeded to menopause at an early age. While not common, this is not abnormal. Also, menopause has nothing to do with your cosmetic procedures that you have had. As for getting pregnant, you will need to see a Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility specialist.

<div class="fullTableCell">Good Testosterone level is where patients feels better...without hurting the patient!!<br><i>Jul 21, 2020</i>
</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">I have been using Testosterone and Estradiol bio pellets for about 2 years now. I do not get my patients to low normal male levels because those are normal for males.

</div>
<div class="fullTableCell">Hello, looking at your pictures, I think you would be a great candidate for the CoolSculpting treatments. You appear to have stubborn subcutaneous fat which is preciously what CoolSculpting was designed to treat. You will probably need 2 treatments on both halves of your belly about 6 weeks apart between treatments. CoolSculpting reduces between 20-30% of the fat cells with each treatment.
